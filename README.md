# DO NOT DELETE THE ORIGINAL DIFFICULTY! LEAVE IT TO APPLY ANY CHANGES, AS THE DERANDOMIZED DIFF IS VERY EASY TO MESS UP BY MAKING SMALL CHANGES AND WON'T WORK IF YOU RUN THE DERANDOMIZER ON IT AGAIN

**You need [.NET Desktop Runtime 3.1.17](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1) in order to run this program**

### How to install
- Download the latest version [here](https://github.com/Phob144/DropletDerandomizer/releases)
- Unpack the file and place it anywhere on your PC
- Run the program by starting DropletDerandomizer.exe (hope i didn't forget to put it here lol)

Libraries from [the osu!lazer project](https://github.com/ppy/osu) were used for this program as well as [OsuParsers](https://github.com/mrflashstudio/OsuParsers/)
